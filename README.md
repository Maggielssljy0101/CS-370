Current/Emerging Trends in CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I developed a reinforcement learning agent—a pirate navigating a grid to locate treasure and avoid obstacles. I was provided with a basic environment setup and framework to get started, including some initial agent structure and environment rules. From there, I created the deep Q-learning logic myself. This included designing the neural network model, building the training loop, managing epsilon-greedy exploration, implementing reward feedback, and fine-tuning hyperparameters for better agent performance. I also handled visualization and evaluation of the agent’s learning process over time.

Throughout this course, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how artificial intelligence—and reinforcement learning specifically—fits into the larger field of computer science. Computer scientists design systems that solve real-world problems using algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. Their work matters because it powers the technologies that drive innovation, from smart assistants to medical diagnostics to self-driving cars. Reinforcement learning, for example, plays a role in robotics, logistics, finance, and even personalized content recommendations.


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, my approach to problem-solving has become more systematic. I now focus on breaking down complex problems into smaller components, analyzing patterns, testing hypotheses, and iterating based on outcomes. This mindset helps me work through technical challenges in a structured, efficient way.

Ethically, I understand the importance of ensuring that the systems we create are fair, transparent, and secure. As developers, we have a responsibility to protect user data, avoid introducing harmful bias into our models, and ensure our solutions are accessible and aligned with the needs of end users. Whether building an AI agent or a user-facing application, it is critical to prioritize ethical considerations alongside technical implementation.
